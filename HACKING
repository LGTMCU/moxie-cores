Hacking on moxie-cores
========================

SBCL and QuickLisp
--------------------

The build procedure for some cores use scripts written in Common Lisp
along with libraries from the QuickLisp distriution.  

After installing sbcl, run the following commands:

$ curl -O http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
$ sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp

Then, at the sbcl prompt, "(quicklisp-quickstart:install)", and
"(ql:add-to-init-file)".

This should be all that is required to prepare your quicklisp
environment.



Programming the DE2
---------------------

The Altera bitstream file that is built for marin is called
"marin.sof".  Build it with GNU make in the soc/marin/bards/de2
directory.  Make sure that Altera's jtagd daemon is running as root
and run something like the following to program the DE2 board:

$ quartus_pgm -z -m JTAG -o "p;marin.sof" 

The on-chip bootloader will display FEED on the 7 segment display and
a message to the serial port, which you can connect to with any
terminal program at 9600 N81 (I use minicom on Linux).
