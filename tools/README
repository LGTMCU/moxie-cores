Build Instructions 
===================

This directory contains four scripts to download, build and install
the moxie-elf and moxie-rtems GNU toolchains.  The toolchains are
installed under a new directory hierarchy off of this directory called
'root'.

Run 'download-tools-sources.sh' to download the latest development
sources.

Run 'update-tools-sources.sh' if you've already downloaded the sources
and just want to pull down updates.

Run 'build-elf-tools.sh' to build the full moxie-elf GNU toolchain.

Run 'build-rtems-tools.sh' to build the full moxie-rtems GNU toolchain
as well as the RTEMS operating system as well.
